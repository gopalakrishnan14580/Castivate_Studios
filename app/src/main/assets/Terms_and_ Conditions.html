<strong>9. Warranty</strong>
<p>We endeavor to provide the best service we can. However, THE CASTIVATE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND. YOU USE THE CASTIVATE SERVICE AT YOUR OWN RISK. CASTIVATE DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. </p>
<p>In addition, Castivate does not warrant, endorse, guarantee or assume responsibility for any Third Party Applications, Third Party content, User Content, or any other product or service advertised or offered by a third party on or through the Castivate or any hyperlinked website, or featured in any advertising.

<p>Nothing in these Agreements removes or limits Castivate’s liability for fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, death or personal injury caused by its negligence. Some aspects of this section may not apply in some jurisdictions.</p>

<strong>11. Severability</strong>
<p>If any provision within these terms be deemed invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, it shall in no way render the remaining provisions of the terms as invalid or unenforceable, and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.</p>

<strong>12. Choice of law, mandatory arbitration and venue</strong>
<p>These Agreements are subject to the laws of the State of California, United States, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles. Furthermore, you and Castivate agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in Santa Clara County, California to resolve any dispute, claim or controversy that arises from these Agreements.</p>
<p>You and Castivate agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the Castivate app service or your use thereof, including our Agreements, shall be determined by mandatory binding arbitration. You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Castivate are each waiving the right to a trial by jury and the right to participate in a class or multi-party action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Agreements and the cessation of your use of Castivate. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by these Agreements, and as administered by the AAA. You and Castivate agree that these Agreements involve interstate commerce and are subject to the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<p>You and Castivate agree that (a) any claims seeking to enforce, protect, or determine the validity or ownership of any intellectual property rights, and (b) any claims related to allegations of theft, piracy or unauthorized use of the Castivate Service are NOT subject to mandatory arbitration. Instead, you and Castivate agree that these claims (including but not limited to claims for injunctive or equitable relief) shall be exclusively decided by courts of competent jurisdiction in Santa Clara County, California and that applicable California and/or Federal law shall govern, without regard to choice of law principles.</p>
<p>YOU AND CASTIVATE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A CLASS MEMBER OR IN ANY REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR PROCEEDING. Further, no arbitrator shall consolidate any other person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a multi-party or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable in any way, then the entirety of this arbitration section shall be null and void. The arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief.</p>
<p>Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration with the AAA within ONE (1) YEAR after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission or default giving rise to the claim; and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period. If applicable law prohibits a one-year limitations period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be limited to those fees set forth in the AAA's Consumer Rules with the remainder paid by Castivate. Any arbitration costs or fees deemed “excessive” will be paid by Castivate.</p>
