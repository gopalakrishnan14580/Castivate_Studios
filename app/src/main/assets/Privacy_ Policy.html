<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<strong>1. Entire Policy</strong>
<p>Your privacy is extremely important to us.  To that effect, this Privacy Policy will explain how we collect, use and disclose information that we receive when you use our Services (as defined in our Terms of Service, accessible at <a href="http://www.castivate.com/terms">  castivate.com/privacy-policy.html </a>).  This Privacy Policy applies only to those features included within “Services.”  Our Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party options we may offer, even if they are accessible through our Services.  Please note that all capitalized words used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service, unless explicitly defined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Our policy may occasionally change.  Please check our website periodically for any updates.</p>
<p>Our policy applies only to the Castivate App and the Services we provide.  It doesn't apply to services you use to obtain the Castivate app, to services of others that you might find by using Castivate, or to other services that may coexist with Castivate.  It also does not apply to interactions with other mobile devices or with internet or social media sites (such as Facebook or Twitter).</p>
<p>This policy does not apply to other companies that might acquire our assets (including our user information), absorb us, or control us.  We can't control what others do in those situations.  Please consult these companies themselves for their own privacy policies.
</p>

<strong>2. Our Information Collection and Use</strong>
<p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer the Castivate Services, and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our App.</p>

<strong>3. Your Use of the Services</strong>
<p>Our servers automatically record limited information about how our Services are utilized (we refer to this information as “Log Data”). This Log Data includes time spent in our App, frequency of use, and other usage analytics.  This information is used to administer the Castivate Services and we analyze (and may engage third party analytics) this information to improve and enhance our Services. We utilize Google Analytics to collect Log Data on our behalf, and Google has its own privacy governing the use of Log Data collected via the Services, accessible at <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a>.</p>

<strong>4. Third Party Sharing</strong>
<p>We do not share any data that we have collected from you except: We may share aggregated information and non-identifying information with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other usage data.</p>

<strong>5. Our Protection and the Protection of Others</strong>
<p>Our policy is to protect you from privacy violations through abuse of the legal systems, whether by individuals, non-governmental organizations, or governments.  We will contest claims that we believe to be invalid under applicable law.  However, we will cooperate with government, law enforcement officials and private parties acting within the established legal limits.  We reserve the right to use our discretion in deciding whether or not they are acting with the law and to  disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we believe necessary.  The following is how we will guide our decisions: (i) to satisfy or comply with any applicable local laws, regulations or legal processes or to respond to lawful requests, including subpoenas, warrants or court orders; (ii) to protect our the rights and safety to our property and the rights, property and safety of third parties or the public in general; and (iv) to prevent or stop activity we deem to be illegal or unethical.</p>

<strong>6. Links to Other Sites</strong>
<p>Castivate’s Services may contain links to other websites and services.  Any information that you provide to a third-party website or service is given directly to the owner of that website or service and is subject to its privacy policy.  We’re not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of those websites or services. To protect your information carefully read the privacy policies of third-party services that you access. </p>

<strong>7. Information you Provide about other Users. </strong>
<p>The "Share" feature on the Castivate App allows you to send a text or email to friends, allowing them to visit Castivate and use the Services. To use the "Share" feature, your friend's name and email address or phone number will need to be provided.  If you provide this information, we will automatically generate a one-time email or text asking your friend(s) to visit the Sites.  Your friend's name and email address will be used for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email or text from your device.  After the message is sent, your friend’s provided information will not be used for any other purpose and will be deleted from our database within a reasonable time period, unless your friend elects to use the Castivate App and independently provides this information to us.  We cannot guarantee privacy if you use the app to post on social media sites (Twitter, FB, etc).</p>

<strong>8. Our Policy Toward Children </strong>
<p>The Castivate App and related Services are not directed towards children 13 and younger. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13, and if we learn that we have mistakenly collected such personal information, we delete all relevant information from our database as soon as possible.  This may require terminating an account.</p>

<strong>9. Changes to Privacy Policy</strong>
<p>All data we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy at the time such information is collected. We may, however, modify and revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make substantial modifications to this Privacy Policy, we’ will inform you by posting them on the Services or by sending you an email or other notification, and we will clearly state when the changes take effect.</p>
